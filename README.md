# Code Refactor Starter Code

# <Bootcamp Challenge 1 >

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind this challenge was to improve the quality of the Horiseon website by refactoring the code. I built this project in order to improve my own understanding of refactorization and deployment and also to see how code changes directly impact the front-end UI of a website. This challenge solves two problems: 1. improving the legibility of the code for other developers and improving the UI functionality for website viewers. By doing this, I learned about how individual naming elements and attributes impact various portions of a website's UI and how small tweaks can drastically impact the transferability of code.
